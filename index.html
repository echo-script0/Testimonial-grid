                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 
                weeks were the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've 
                successfully switched carrers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp. I've 
                never written a line of code. I needed
                some structure from professionals 
                who can help me learn programming
                step by step. I was encouraged to 
                enroll by a former student of theirs 
                who can only say wonderful things 
                about the program. The entire 
                curriculum and staff did not 
                disappoint. They were very hands-on 
                and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in 
                particular, was outstanding. It took 
                my learning to the next level in a way 
                that no tutorial could ever have. In 
                fact, I've often referred to it during 
                interviews as an example of my 
                development experience. It certainly 
                helped me land a job as a full-stack 
                developer after receiving multiple 
                offers. 100% recommend!"
